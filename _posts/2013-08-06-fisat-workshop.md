KRUG members organized a day long Ruby programming workshop at FISAT today. It was attended by around 20 participants.

The workshop started off with covering the basics of Ruby. This was followed by building a live coding session by [Akhil Stanislavose](https://github.com/akhilstanislavose) where he built a simple command-line movie search app. He then converted this into a web app using Sinatra.
