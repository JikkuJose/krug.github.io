# Overview of August, 2012 meetup

We had a great meetup this afternoon. Here's a quick summary of the meetup:

* Sumit Asok spoke about Test Driven Development and gave some excellent advice on doing TDD right. Sumit explained some of the best practices when it comes to doing TDD with Rspec. 

PS. Thanks Sumit for traveling all the way from Bangalore for doing this talk. :)

* Ehthisham TK spoke about Ruboto - Ruby on Android. Ruboto is a framework for developing apps using JRuby on Android. He also gave a quick demo of developing an app using the Ruboto framework.

* After the talks, the participants had discussions on various technologies. There were even some humorous and friendly diversions towards some of the classic programmer flame wars - Ruby vs Python, Rails vs Django, Sublime vs Vim vs Emacs, and editors vs IDEs. The people attending included Ruby, Python, Java and front end developers - hence the diversity in opinions. ;-)

* The attendance was lower compared to the last meetup, but there was plenty of enthusiastic participation from those who did attend. :)

* The venue and date for future meetups was also discussed. We would love to host the event every month at WowMakers, but I agree that it would be best for the community if other Ruby shops also would get to host the meetups. :)

* It was also felt that Sundays aren't the best day for meetups and Saturdays would be preferable for most people. So, for the September meetup, we'll discuss here and pick a different date.

Would love to hear opinions about #5 and #6. Please do reply with your thoughts. Also, if anyone's interested in doing a talk at next month's meetup, please do reply here. :)
