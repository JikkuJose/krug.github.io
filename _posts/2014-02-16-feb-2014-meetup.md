# Summary

* Deepak Kumar gave an introductory talk on Google's Go programming language. This led to much discussion about features of different programming languages.
* Since the majority of the people attending were new to Ruby, Nithin Bekal did an introductory talk on Ruby, explaining the basic concepts and how to get started.
* One interesting suggestion was that we include a short, beginner-level talk at every Ruby meetup to help newcomers get started with Ruby.
* The talks are followed by general discussion on programming and philosophy led by Praseed Pai.
