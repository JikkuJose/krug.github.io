Here's a quick roundup of last weekend's meetup:

* [Vishnu Gopal](https://twitter.com/vishnugopal) from Mobme spoke about how they use Ruby at Mobme. He spoke about the non-Rails usage of Ruby and specifically spoke about two gems - sync_service and async_service that are used at Mobme for synchronous SOA daemons and daemons for processing work from queues respectively.

* Akhil Stanislavose spoke about Background processing in Rails - and the delayed_job gem in particular. This was also followed by a demo of the gem and a discussion on background processing in general.

* There was also a discussion about how the Ruby community in Kochi could collaborate on some open source project - either a new one or an existing project. Hopefully we can have more discussion on this idea here on the mailing list.

* Another discussion that happened was about the use of Rails for open source projects - and Projects Fedena in particular - and whether the problems in upgrading such projects from Rails 2.x to 3.x has discouraged community participation in such projects.

We also discussed whether we could have the next meetup in a hackathon format. That's another topic that needs discussion here.
