<ul>
<li>
<p>Harisankar presented a talk about the Cuba microframework. This was followed by Q&amp;A and discussions about some of the Cuba code examples.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I presented an intro to Ruby aimed mainly at newbies. This was followed by a general discussion about the language and the Ruby ecosystem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Most of the people who attended were experienced with Ruby, and the talks and discussions had gone on for a while, so we didn&#8217;t have the coding sessions for beginners that we had initially planned.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The turnout at the meetup was a pleasant surprise, as there were around 18 people there. Turnout at events is usually much lower than the RSVPs, but this was just one short of the Facebook RSVPs. Hopefully we&#8217;ll have even better participation for the next meetup.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We all felt that this mailing list is the best place for planning for the next meetup and proposing talks. The space at Startup Village is always available as the venue. We just need volunteers now for speaking at the next meetup. :)</p>
