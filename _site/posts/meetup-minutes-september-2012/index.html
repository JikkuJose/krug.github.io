  <p>Here&#8217;s a quick roundup of last weekend&#8217;s meetup:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Vishnu Gopal from Mobme spoke about how they use Ruby at Mobme. He spoke about the non-Rails usage of Ruby and specifically spoke about two gems - sync_service and async_service that are used at Mobme for synchronous SOA daemons and daemons for processing work from queues respectively.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Akhil Stanislavose spoke about Background processing in Rails - and the delayed_job gem in particular. This was also followed by a demo of the gem and a discussion on background processing in general.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>There was also a discussion about how the Ruby community in Kochi could collaborate on some open source project - either a new one or an existing project. Hopefully we can have more discussion on this idea here on the mailing list.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Another discussion that happened was about the use of Rails for open source projects - and Projects Fedena in particular - and whether the problems in upgrading such projects from Rails 2.x to 3.x has discouraged community participation in such projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We also discussed whether we could have the next meetup in a hackathon format. That&#8217;s another topic that needs discussion here.</p>
